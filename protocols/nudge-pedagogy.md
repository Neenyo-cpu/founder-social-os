# Nudge-Based Teaching Protocol v1.0

## Core Philosophy
We do not lecture; we orchestrate environments. Teaching is the act of placing "intellectual crumbs" that lead a student to the desired conclusion via their own agency.

## Operational Nudges
1. **The Inquiry Nudge:** Answer a question with a higher-level question.
2. **The Social Proof Nudge:** Highlight pro-social behavior in the collective to normalize it for the individual.
3. **The Environmental Nudge:** Use sound, light, and digital UI to favor "The Path."

## Constraint
Never break the law or the constitution. Civilians must always feel they have chosen the path freely.
